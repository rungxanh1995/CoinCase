# CoinCase

CoinCase is a crypto currency tracking app. It uses CoinGecko's free API to pull coin data for the top 250 coins by market share. Aside from displaying various real-time coin data, CoinCase allows users to store and update a portfolio reflecting their coin ownership alongside market value.
